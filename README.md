# ðŸ‘ª Twitter Follow Back and Unfollow non Followers ðŸ‘ª
With local storage. 

## âš  Run at your own Risk. But it should operate within the limits of the API âš 
## This Program is still very new and might contain some bugs.


Install ðŸ‘‡
This Script Uses the twitter-api-v2 npm module Found here https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter-api-v2

I suggest you find a way to run it in the background so you don't closet the program.

To run the Following.js Script Fill out the config file with the following keys and tokens from your twitter developer account. 
Also set Follow and Unfollow with the Proper attribute [True Or False]

```javascript
export default {
    bearer : <YourKeyHere>,
    appKey: <YourKeyHere>,
    appSecret: <YourKeyHere>,
    accessToken: <YourKeyHere>,
    accessSecret: <YourKeyHere>,
    // Your Twitter Username "QvsNP" for example [Don't add @]
    userName: "QvsNP",
    //Script will follow back people who follw you if this is set to true
    //Else set it to false if you don't want the script to follow back
    follow: true,
    //Script will unfollow people who don't follow you. If this is set to true
    //Else set it to false if you don't want the script to unfollow
    unfollow: true,
}
```

## If it does not seem to run properly then Delete the dbFollow folder the script created it will be created in the same directy as the script
